            <h2>What is the treaty of waitangi?</h2><br><h3>The Treaty is an agreement, written in both Māori and English, to address various issues arising from the influx of British migrants to New Zealand in the late 1830s.
These issues included large-scale land transactions with Māori, unruly behavior by some settlers, and concerns about French interest in annexing New Zealand.
The British government eventually realized that annexing the country could protect Māori, regulate British subjects, and secure commercial interests.
